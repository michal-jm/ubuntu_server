vm ubuntu settings/network attached to: internal network
motd-news - edit /etc/defaults/motd.news, ENABLED=0 (this will disable this nuseance)

# ip config
/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
# before ubuntu 17.10 ip config settings were in:
/etc/network/interfaces

# find network card's name
ifconfig -a or ip a

# set up ip config on command line (destroyed when machine powers down/resets)
ip a 172.16.10.1/24 dev enpOs9
# switch internet card on
ip l set enpO9 up

# set up ip config in config file
file looks like following:
# bla
# bla

network:
    ethernets:
        enpOs3:
            dhcp:true
        enpOs8:
            addresses:
            - 10.0.0.1/24
            nameservers: {}
here we add
         enpOs9:
         addresses:
         - 172.16.10.1/24
         gateway4: 172.16.10.254 # gateway address - if addidng gateway -->  IPv4 then gateway4 (at the moment this is fake address so internet connection will be interrupted
         nameservers: {} # in case when adding gateway remove bracket s and continue on the line below
           addresses: [8.8.8.8, 4.4.4.4]
this was here in the original file:
     version: 2
# to reset setting
netplan apply

# as tehe getaway4 is fake the virtual machine will loses internet access. To restore the access remove the line that starts getaway4 (line 37 above)
