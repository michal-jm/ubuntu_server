 1. sticky bit - prevents non user from removing file
 2. user id bit
 3. group id bit
 
 1. sticky bit
 # add a sticky bit to folder:
 chmod a+t <folder_name> or chmod 1777 <folder_name>
 
 # bit 'g' (rozumiane jako grupa)
 # if such bit is added to a folder then (regardles of who creates folders within this folder) all the new folders will belong to the group that owns the 'roor' folder wiht sticky bit 'g' attached to it
chmod g+t <folder_name> or chmod 2777 <folder_name>
!! if such bit is added to a file then the file is executed based on group permissions not on the one who executes it

bit specialny UID
chmod u+s <folder_name> (or file name)
# then user who executes will execute with owner permission not as himself
