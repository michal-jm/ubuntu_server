# check if ssh is running
systemctl status ssh

# in case no service install it:
sudo apt install openssh-server

# find ip
ip a

# there are 2 ways to configure ssh on vm:
# 1 use card in 'nat' mode with port forwarding
# 2 use bridge adapter and ip from the same range as outside network (how to find out outside network??)
